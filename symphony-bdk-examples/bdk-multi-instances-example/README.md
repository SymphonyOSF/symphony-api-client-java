# How to run multiple bot instances?
This example aims to demonstrate how to make your bot scalable and highly available. For that,
[docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) creates 1 bot producer and 2 bot consumers. 

The producer is the bot that handles the Datafeed Real Time Events and pushes then into a Kafka topic.
See [RealTimeEventsKafkaProducer.java](./src/main/java/com/symphony/bdk/examples/kafka/producer/RealTimeEventsKafkaProducer.java).

The consumers are only listening to the same Kafka topic, and reply in the chat with there assigned consumer id.
See [RealTimeEventsKafkaConsumer.java](./src/main/java/com/symphony/bdk/examples/kafka/consumer/RealTimeEventsKafkaConsumer.java).

## Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)  
- [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)

## How to run
In order to run this example, execute the following commands: 
```shell
export BOT_HOST=develop2.symphony.com 
export BOT_USERNAME=changeit
export BOT_PK_PATH=/path/to/bot/privatekey.pem 
gradle build && docker-compose up --build
```
Once your bot instances successfully started, you should observe:
```
5:40:35pm User:
> hello 
5:40:37pm Bot:
> Consumer 'bot-consumer-01' received : hello
5:40:38pm User:
> hello again
5:40:40pm Bot:
> Consumer 'bot-consumer-02' received : hello again
5:50:15 User:
> How are you? 
5:50:16 Bot:
> Consumer 'bot-consumer-01' received : How are you?
6:01:22pm User:
> Are you sure you are alone?
6:01:23pm Bot:
> Consumer 'bot-consumer-02' received : Are you sure you are alone?
```
